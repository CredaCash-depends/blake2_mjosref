# blake2_mjosref
A simple implementation of the BLAKE2b and BLAKE2s hash function -- written while writing the RFC.

This is just an another -- somewhat smaller -- implementation of BLAKE2,
written while working on the RFC text. Some stuff regarding parameter
handling has been simplified.

See blake2.net for more information.
